                    <p>Effective Date: January 1, 2023</p>
                    <p>Posted Date: December 28, 2022</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2 class="ud-section-title">I. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>At a11n, data privacy is important to us. This a11n Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) details our privacy practices for the activities described in this Privacy Policy. Please take the time to read this Privacy Policy carefully in order to understand how we collect, share, and otherwise process information relating to individuals (“Personal Data”), and to learn about your rights and choices regarding our processing of your Personal Data.</p>
                    <p>In this Privacy Policy, “a11n,” “we,” “our,” and “us” each mean a11n and the applicable a11n affiliate(s) involved in the processing activity. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2 class="ud-section-title">II. a11n’s Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>a11n is the controller of your Personal Data, as described in this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise stated.&nbsp; Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that we process Personal Data in the role of a processor (or a comparable role such as a “service provider” in certain jurisdictions) on behalf of our customers, including where we offer to our customers various cloud products and services, through which our customers (and/or their affiliates) connect their own websites and applications to our hosted platform (including our a11n-branded services), sell or offer their own products and services, send electronic communications to other individuals, or otherwise collect, use, share or process Personal Data via our cloud products and services.</p>
                    <p>Each of our customers, not a11n, controls whether they provide you with an account or other access to the a11n authorization cloud service through their subscription, and if they provide you with such accounts or other access through their subscription, they control what information about you that they submit to our service. This content may include contact information (such as your first and last name, email address, and phone number), professional information (such as the department you work for at your place of employment), or other types of information that a customer chooses to submit. Use of this content by a11n is governed by agreements between a11n and the Customer.</p>
                    <p>For detailed privacy information applicable to situations where an a11n customer (and/or a customer affiliate) who uses a11n’s cloud products and services is the controller, please reach out to the respective customer directly. We are not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this Privacy Policy. If not stated otherwise either in this Privacy Policy or in a separate disclosure, we process such Personal Data in the role of a processor or service provider on behalf of a customer (and/or its affiliates), who is the responsible controller of the applicable Personal Data.</p>
                    <p>If your Personal Data has been submitted to us by or on behalf of an a11n customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please inquire with the applicable customer directly. Because we may only access a customer’s data upon instruction from that customer, if you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide to us the name of the a11n customer who submitted your Personal Data to us. If we are able to verify the a11n customer, we will refer your request to that customer and support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2 class="ud-section-title">III. Personal Data We Collect and Data Sources</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Covered Data Processing Activities</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the processing of Personal Data that we collect in the following ways, as detailed in this section.</p>
                    <p>We collect information about you when you provide it to us, when you interact with our websites and electronic systems, when you attend events and visit our offices, and when other sources provide it to us, as further described below.</p>
                    <p><strong>Information you provide to us</strong></p>
                    <p>Based on our current practices (and including our practices over the last 12 months), we collect the following categories of information about you:</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Contact and Professional Data</em>:</strong> We collect contact and/or professional data about you in person, through communications, including communications from you or your colleagues, and through our websites. For example, you provide your contact and professional information to us when you sign up to learn more about a11n’s products and services, download content, register for an event, and visit our offices. If you attend an event, we may also receive contact and professional details about you when you choose to scan your attendee badge or by providing a business card or other method(s) whereby you share Personal Data with us. Typically, contact data includes your name and contact methods, such as telephone number, email address, and office or other mailing address, and professional data includes details such as the organization you are affiliated with, your job title, and industry.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Administrator Data</em>: </strong>When you sign up for an account to try a11n, subscribe to any a11n service via a11n or another entity (such as a marketplace or authorized reseller), have the ability to submit a support request, or are designated an administrator of any part of the a11n Service, then information is provided to us about you (“Administrator Data”). Administrator Data usually includes your name, email address, phone number, address, billing information, business contact information, credentials information (including a11n training and credentials), subscription and service configurations you select, and other details you may provide to us about you or include in your profiles in a11n communities and other support portals. We may also receive any Personal Data you share via tooling used to provide support, <em>e.g.</em>, videoconferencing or other communication methods you participate in.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Biographical, Community, and Support Data</em>:</strong> We may also collect various types of biographical, community, and support Personal Data from you via our help center and community support forums. For example, if you register for an online community that we host, we may ask you to provide a username, photo and/or biographical information, such as your occupation, organization name and areas of expertise. Additionally, you may provide Personal Data to us when you create user-generated content (for example, by posting in a forum), provide a11n with feedback, or when you participate in interactive features, trainings, online surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, activities, or events. a11n may receive Personal Data and Administrator Data in connection with an administrator's request for support for the a11n service.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Job Applicant Data</em>:</strong> We collect contact and professional information, including your resume with educational and work background, that you provide when you apply for a job with a11n. We may also collect sensitive information, like your ID Number or other government identifier, racial or ethnic origin, or other such Personal Data that you provide in connection with your job application.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Contract and Payment Data</em>:</strong> We may receive contract details (like signatures) from you or your organization and use payment processing services to collect payment and billing information, which may contain Personal Data such as billing name, billing address and payment card details, in connection with some of our products and services.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Audio, Electronic, or Visual Data</em>:</strong> If you attend an a11n in-person or virtual event or agree to be recorded in a telephone or video meeting, we may record some or all of that event or meeting. For events, we may document the event in various ways, such as by taking photos at the event, interviewing you at the event, or recording your participation in a live question-and-answer or other interactive session. We use this information for business and marketing purposes to better inform the public about a11n, its events, and provide testimonials about our products and services.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Consumer Products</em>:</strong> If you use consumer products made available by a11n (“a11n Consumer Products”), then we may receive various types of information and content from you that you choose to share, including contact information (such as your first and last name, email address, and phone number), additional multi-factor authentication factor setup details, content you upload (such as identification or other documentation), and information regarding the websites and applications that you visit and use through a11n Consumer Products for authentication. We also receive Ancillary Data, including device data, Usage Data, and metadata, as described below for the purposes described below.</p>
                    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, if we collect sensitive data from you, we will do so by providing you with additional notice or confirming your consent upon collection.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Personal Data We Collect From Other Sources</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the course of doing business (and over the 12 months preceding the effective date of this Privacy Policy), we receive Personal Data and other information from other third parties for our business or commercial purposes. This information varies and typically falls into a few categories:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Business contact information (such as name, job title, business email, phone number, and address), social profile (such as LinkedIn or XING) including other details about your organization for sales and marketing purposes, to better inform you about a11n products and services;</li>
                      <li>Third-party platform usernames and identifying information;</li>
                      <li>Details about you as a job candidate (which may include your name, resume, educational and work history, criminal history information, and feedback) as permitted under law; and</li>
                      <li>Data used for security purposes to protect our products and services.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We receive business contact information that contains Personal Data for commercial purposes, including details about your organization from third parties for marketing and business intelligence, such as analyzing business opportunities, identifying and communicating with potential customers, and providing our audience with more relevant content and advertising. Typically, we receive this information about you from a few sources, such as: (i) third-party marketing initiatives, such as events where we are a sponsor, or website forms hosted by third parties that may provide content about us; (ii) instances when you consent to having your attendee badge scanned at an event hosted by us or another entity; (iii) companies, such as information aggregators and similar entities, from whom we have licensed business contact information; (iv) referrals; or (v) resellers and channel partners, including those that offer joint marketing services. In some situations, we may combine such business contact information with other non-personal and Personal Data we possess or that you have provided to us. For example, we may combine business contact details with details about your organization, such as its address or revenue range, and analyze this information for business opportunities or use this to send you tailored content.</p>
                    <p>We also receive Personal Data to help with threat intelligence and to protect the safety and security of our service and our customers’ applications, such as breached website credentials from other entities. We use this Personal Data for various purposes, such as for security and fraud detection purposes and to enable our customers to configure the settings within the a11n products and services to notify their administrators and users if the data that they put into the a11n service is found within this data set.</p>
                    <p>We also receive information from third-party platforms for various business purposes such as organizational credit information, program management, or technical reasons. For example, we may receive credit information about an organization that includes the names of individuals. If you participate in an open source project or our bug bounty program, we may receive details about you, such as your username or pull requests, to help us manage your participation in the project or program and provide you with updates.</p>
                    <p>If you are a candidate applying for a job at a11n, we may receive Personal Data about you from third parties for business purposes, such as through background checks (educational, employment, criminal, and financial information), publicly-available sources (like social media accounts, including LinkedIn for identifying candidates), feedback about your application and from interviews, and other third parties that may provide feedback about your application.</p>
                    <p>For our professional services work, as a processor or service provider, a11n may also receive Personal Data about you to perform its obligations under its contract with a third party. a11n partners may also share your business contact information with a11n as part of their recommendation to your organization to become an a11n customer. If a11n is interested in partnering with, acquiring, investing in, or partners with, acquires, or invests in your employing or retaining organization, a11n may receive Personal Data about you through the (potential or completed) transaction for its business purposes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Device Data, Usage Data, Metadata, and Diagnostic Data We Collect</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation of Device Data, Usage Data, Diagnostic Data, and Other Metadata and Technology Used</strong></p>
                    <p>Like most websites, applications, and software across the Internet, a11n collects certain Personal Data. This type of data collection allows us to better understand how individuals use and the performance of our websites, products and services. For example, we may collect metadata about you, including technical data about your performance or use of our website, products and services. We may also collect device data about you to help us determine that users from one type of device use our websites, products and services in different ways than users of a different type of device, which in turn allows us to troubleshoot and investigate the performance of our products and services, improve our websites, products, and services, such as through optimizing the screen size of a11n mobile applications, or making sure that our customers’ users have a more efficient user experience. We may collect these types of Personal Data as part of the services we provide to customers as well as in connection with your use of a11n Consumer Products.</p>
                    <p>One common technology we use to collect metadata that may be considered Personal Data is our use of cookies. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your web browser and that help us recognize your browser or device as a unique visitor in different ways based on the type of cookie. The three main types of cookies are:</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Essential cookies</em>.</strong> Essential cookies are required for website functionality and security. For example, authentication, security, and session cookies may be required for our website or products to work.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Functional cookies</em>.</strong> We use functional cookies to help enhance our websites’ performance, for market research, or other analytics or advertising that is not tied to a specific individual. For example, we may use Google analytics to help us track how many individuals visited our websites. We may also utilize HTML5 local storage cookies for the reasons described in this section. These types of cookies are different from browser cookies in the amount and type of data they store and how they store it.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Targeting or advertising cookies</em>.</strong> We use targeting and advertising cookies to help us understand our marketing efforts and to reach potential customers across the web. For example, we contract with third-party advertising networks that may track your activity over time and across different channels, including our websites, email activity, and other websites and applications that display advertisements. They may use this tracking information to understand and predict your interests, to display an advertisement for a11n on another website, or email you with a marketing communication for an a11n product.</p>
                    <p>If you would like to manage your cookies and your permissions to share data with cookie providers, please visit the section below on <a href="#your-information-choices">Your Information Choices</a>.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Personal Data Collected Through Our Website, Trainings or Events, and Other Engagement</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As with most websites, whenever you visit an a11n website, take an a11n training course, engage with any a11n communities, or when you interact with a11n promotional or other informational content, a11n may receive both Personal Data about you from information-gathering tools and passive information collection on our websites, including Personal Data from our websites you visit or emails we send. This information collection typically includes information such as cookies, beacons, demographic information, company and role details, market research and publicly-available information, IP address (which may provide information about your location, but not your precise geolocation), device and browser details, usage information, timestamps, pages viewed, searches, interaction with and action taken by you on our websites or content (such as clicks on links and interaction with a webpage), as well as other non-Personal Data.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2 class="ud-section-title">IV. How We Use Personal Data</h2>
                    <p>How we use the Personal Data that we collect depends in part on how you choose to communicate with us, how you use our websites and interact with us, and any preferences you have communicated to us.&nbsp; In general, we use your Personal Data as is necessary to run our business and carry out our day-to-day activities. In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may use your Personal Data to accomplish the following tasks (and we have done so during the 12 months preceding the effective date of this Privacy Policy):</p>
                    <p><strong>For the purpose of communicating with you about our products and services and facilitate other interaction.</strong> We may use your Personal Data, such as contact data, Ancillary Data, and metadata, to send you transactional communications, notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages regarding our products and services that may be useful to you and your organization. We will respond to your questions, provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us, and help you use our products and services effectively. We also use Administrator Data to communicate with you for various purposes, including to provide you with account updates (about your subscription, settings, security, billing, feature and product updates, technical issues, certifications, and other similar content). You cannot unsubscribe from non-promotional and transactional communications. For promotional communications, you may manage your communication preferences via your administrator settings, a11n communities, or our subscription center (linked in the Your Information Choices section below). In some situations, we may also share Administrator Data with authorized partners in order to provide you with information relevant to your purchase of a11n or other entities’ tools that may connect to a11n to meet your technical or organizational needs.</p>
                    <p><strong>For the purpose of supporting safety, security, and manage operations.</strong> We use Personal Data, such as contact data, Ancillary Data and other metadata, about you and your use of our products, services, and offices to verify accounts and activity, monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity, assist our customers in their monitoring of suspicious or fraudulent activity, and identify violations of policies regarding the use of our products and services. We may also combine Ancillary Data with other data we receive for safety, security, and to manage our business operations. We also process Personal Data, such as contact data and health data, for security and operations management reasons, such as to register visitors to our offices and carry out related safety measures, including to manage non-disclosure agreements that visitors may be required to sign. We also use Administrator Data to provide our customers with the a11n service, complete transactions, provide support and other service to the customer account, detect and prevent fraud, for audit and compliance purposes, and to comply with applicable law. a11n physically and electronically monitors its offices with access monitoring software and tools, and has on-premise surveillance cameras in order to prevent unauthorized access to our offices and to protect employees, authorized visitors, and our property.</p>
                    <p><strong>For the purpose of marketing our products and services.</strong> We use your Personal Data, such as contact data, Ancillary Data, and other metadata about how you use the products and services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you and your organization, including by email and by displaying a11n marketing communications on other organizations’ websites and applications, as well as on third-party platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google. These communications are aimed at encouraging engagement and maximizing the benefits that you and your organization can gain from a11n’s products and services, including information about new products and features, survey requests, newsletters, and events that we think may be of interest to you and your organization.</p>
                    <p><strong>For the purpose of analyzing, predicting, and improving results and operations.</strong> We use Personal Data to analyze and predict results (such as those arising from our sales and marketing efforts and product usage and consumption), improve the performance of our websites, products and services and customer support, identify potential customers, opportunities, and potential new product areas, ascertain trends, improve our websites’ functionality, improve our security, and provide us with general business intelligence, including through the use of machine learning technology. We may also combine the metadata and usage information collected from our websites with other information to help further the purposes described in the previous sentence.</p>
                    <p><strong>For the purpose of managing contests or promotions and customer appreciation.</strong> a11n may occasionally run contests or other special promotions or make available opportunities or other tokens of appreciation for customers, and if you register for these, we may process your Personal Data, such as contact information, biographical information, and contract-related data to perform our contract with you. a11n may also use the Personal Data, such as contact data, collected in these contests, promotions, and for customer appreciation as well as to send you gifts or prizes and promotional material about a11n and our partners.</p>
                    <p><strong>For the purpose of processing payments.</strong> We process Personal Data, such as contact information, contract-related data, financial information, biographical information, and payment information to process payments to the extent that doing so is necessary to complete a transaction and perform our contract with you or your organization.</p>
                    <p><strong>For the purpose of recruiting and hiring.</strong> We process your Personal Data, such as contact, job applicant, and biographical data, to assess your application and to evaluate and improve our recruitment system, our application tracking and recruitment activities. We also use your Personal Data to communicate with you regarding your application or opportunities at a11n that appear over time that we believe may be of interest to you. We also use your Personal Data to send you new hire and employee experience information. We may verify your information, including through reference checks and, where allowed, background checks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Other purposes for our legitimate interests:</strong> Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests, or the interests of others, we may use your Personal Data in connection with the management of our business, including but not limited to, for operational purposes and workflow automation, business intelligence (such as to understand subscription consumption and free trial product usage), website and product improvement, legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, protecting against misuse or abuse of our products and services, and protecting personal property or safety. For example, we may review compliance with applicable usage terms in our customer contracts, assess capacity requirements for our products, websites, and offices, improve your user experience, respond to requests by you for support or for contact, or identify customer opportunities. If you sign up to participate in specific programs, such as product feedback programs, we may analyze Ancillary Data, including Usage Data, related to your use of our Service, along with the data you choose to provide to us through a11n Ideas, to provide you with a better customer experience. Furthermore, we use Administrator Data to provide technical support as described in our documentation and help center, and to improve our products, services, and processes related to providing such support.</p>
                    <p><strong>Other purposes with your consent:</strong> We may use your Personal Data if you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote our products and services or record phone calls for quality and training purposes, with your permission.</p>
                    <p>If we process your Personal Data for a purpose other than those set out above, we will provide you with information prior to such processing.</p>
                    <p><strong>Legal Bases for Processing Personal Data (for United Kingdom and European Economic Area and other relevant jurisdictions)</strong></p>
                    <p>If you are an individual in the United Kingdom, the European Economic Area (EEA), or of another relevant jurisdiction, we collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis or bases for doing so under applicable laws. The legal bases depend on the products and services that your organization has purchased from a11n, how such products and services are used, and how you choose to interact and communicate with a11n’s websites, systems, and whether you attend a11n events. This means we collect and use your Personal Data only where:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>We need it to operate and provide you with our products and services, provide customer support and personalized features, and to protect the safety and security of our products and services;</li>
                      <li>It satisfies a legitimate interest of a11n’s (which is not overridden by your data protection interests and rights), such as for research and development, to provide information to you about our products and services that we believe you and your organization may find useful, and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>
                      <li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li>
                      <li>We need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you have consented to our use of Personal Data about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.&nbsp; Where we are using your Personal Data because we or another entity (for example, your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use; however, in some cases, this may mean that you no longer use our products and services.</p>
                    <p>In the event that we de-identify any Personal Data for further use, we commit to maintain and use the information in de-identified form and will not attempt to re-identify the information, except for the purpose of determining if our de-identification processes satisfy applicable legal requirements.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2 class="ud-section-title">V. Personal Data Disclosed by a11n and Data You Choose to Disclose to Other Entities</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Personal Data Disclosed by a11n</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the course of doing business (and over the 12 months preceding the effective date of this Privacy Policy), a11n may disclose Personal Data as described below.</p>
                    <p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> For all categories of information that we collect, we disclose Personal Data to our service providers for various business purposes, including, but not limited to, auditing interactions with users, debugging our websites, products and services, security purposes, internal research and gleaning insights through machine learning, short-term uses such as credit verification, payment processing, IT services, quality control and safety, gift fulfillment, in-person and virtual event management, as well as to perform other services on our behalf. For example, we may use service providers to help us proctor and score a11n certification exams, or host our customer relationship management system.</p>
                    <p><strong>In-person and Virtual Events.</strong> If you choose to register for or attend a virtual or in-person event or webinar that we host (such as our a11nne customer conference), enter a contest or raffle with us and a sponsor, or download content (such as a whitepaper) from our website, then we may disclose your contact information, content interest information or other activity data, and any other information, including Personal Data, collected in the course of these activities for commercial purposes to those sponsors. In many cases, you intentionally disclose your details by providing your information to these sponsors through consent via a registration form or by scanning your badge at the applicable sponsor’s booth. Virtual events hosted by third party platforms may also collect additional data from you when you visit their sites. The treatment of this information is subject to each of these other entities’ respective privacy statements.</p>
                    <p><strong>Partners and Resellers.</strong> We may disclose your Personal Data, such as contact information, business details, and content interest and activity details, to our partners and resellers for business purposes, such as to carry out our business or for joint marketing efforts to reach our customers and prospective customers. In many cases, you intentionally disclose your details by providing your information to these sponsors through consent via a registration form. You can review a list of our current partners here.</p>
                    <p><strong>Protection of Rights, Security and Fraud Detection.</strong> For all categories of data we collect, we disclose your Personal Data for business purposes to protect our customers and users, to secure our physical and intellectual property, and to prevent or investigate security or fraudulent attempts against our users through our platform.</p>
                    <p><strong>Law Enforcement and Legal Requests.</strong> For all categories of data we collect, we may disclose Personal Data to comply with applicable law or to respond to valid legal requests, such as a subpoena, from law enforcement or other authorities.</p>
                    <p><strong>With our Affiliates, Related to Corporate Transactions, and Provision of Professional Services.</strong> For all categories of data we collect, we disclose Personal Data to our affiliates and subsidiaries for business purposes, including any service providers and agents that work on our behalf. For example, we may disclose your Personal Data to support service providers with whom we have in place agreements to protect your Personal Data. We may also disclose your information as required for us to carry out a corporate transaction, such as a merger or sale of assets of all or part of our company. We will also disclose your Personal Data to our professional service providers (for example, our auditors, insurance providers, financial service providers, and legal advisors) as needed for us to run our business.</p>
                    <p><strong>Platform, Training, and Community Analytics Data.</strong> We disclose Ancillary Data, such as metadata (for example, unique identifiers and Usage Data), collected through our platform with analytics service providers for our business purposes, such as to provide a better user experience and improve our products and services.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advertising and Marketing.</strong> We share your Personal Data, such as metadata and contact data, with third-party advertising and marketing providers, to allow us to better reach our customers and prospective customers, and to sell our products and services. In some circumstances, we may ask you to consent to directly disclosing your Personal Data with these third parties prior to sharing your Personal Data, such as via a consent banner on our website. For details on your choices with respect this sharing or disclosure, please see <a href="#your-information-choices">Your Information Choices</a> below. For specific details on these companies’ privacy practices, please visit their privacy policies.</p>
                    <p><strong>Anonymous or De-identified Usage Data.</strong> We disclose anonymized or aggregated usage data or security threat information with third parties or the public. For example, this may include disclosing trends regarding organizations’ use of a11n’s products and services to customers and prospective customers in our “Businesses at Work” report. The data disclosed in this category is not Personal Data.</p>
                    <p><strong>a11n Communities, Help Center, and Other User Generated Content.</strong> We make available various community forums and self-help support materials, as well as blogs and other means for you to post information on our websites. This information you post is publicly-available information that you choose to disclose and it may be read, collected, and processed by others that visit these websites. Except for username (which may be your real name) and the details that you choose to include in your profile, the categories of data disclosed in these circumstances will depend on what information you choose to provide.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recruitment Data. </strong>When you apply for a job at a11n, we disclose your Personal Data, including applicant data, biographical information, and other Personal Data we possess to our affiliate companies for business reasons, such as human resource management and internal reporting; our service providers for business reasons, such as the recruitment platform, to verify references and to manage background checks; and law enforcement or government authorities, or as otherwise necessary to comply with law or as needed for the recruitment and human resources process.</p>
                    <p><strong>a11n Social Media Outlets</strong></p>
                    <p>a11n’s websites may use social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button, the Instagram “heart” button, Twitter sharing features, and other similar widgets (“Social Media Features”). You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on a website to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third-party social media network in order to share content with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by the respective social media network, or hosted directly on our websites. To the extent the Social Media Features are hosted by the respective social media networks and you click through to these from our website, the latter may receive information showing that you have visited our website. If you are logged in to your social media account, it is possible that the respective social media network can link your visit to our websites with your social media profile.</p>
                    <p>Your interactions with Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policies (and any other applicable terms) of the respective companies that provide the relevant Social Media Features.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2 class="ud-section-title">VI. a11n’s Security Posture &amp; Measures Taken</h2>
                    <p>Security is a critical priority for a11n. We maintain a comprehensive, written information security program that contains industry-standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access to Personal Data.</p>
                    <p>However, no security system is perfect, and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, including Personal Data, is absolutely safe from intrusion or other unauthorized access by others. You are responsible for protecting your password(s) and other authentication factors, as well as maintaining the security of your devices.</p>
          <p>If you use the a11n online service via a subscription purchased for you by an a11n customer, then that customer is responsible for configuring your instance appropriately.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2 class="ud-section-title">VIII. Children</h2>
                    <p>a11n’s websites are not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with Personal Data without your consent, please contact us by using the information in the “How to Contact Us” section, below, and we will take steps to delete such Personal Data from our systems.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>








                    <h2 class="ud-section-title">IX. How Long Does a11n Keep Your Data?</h2>
                    <p>We will retain your Personal Data for a period of time that is consistent with the original purpose of the data collection, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data by considering the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, and on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).</p>
